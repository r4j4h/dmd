Implement DIP 1038: @mustuse

`@mustuse` is a new attribute that can be applied to a `struct` or `union` type
to make ignoring an expression of that type into a compile-time error. It can
be used to implement alternative error-handling mechanisms for code that cannot
use exceptions, including `@nogc` and BetterC code.
